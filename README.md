# Lab 1 Assignment - Calculating rain runoff

When agricultural land is paved over, rainwater cannot be absorbed as easily, resulting in the runoff of rainwater. In some cases, this runoff can lead to increases in flooding or landslides. The runoff also presents an opportunity to capture and/or recycle it. Weâ€™re going to write a short script to calculate the amount of rain run off of a single plot of land (50 feet by 20 feet) in Kenya during a very small rainstorm. You may be as astonished as we were to learn how much it is. Take a guess: what is the volume of water that runs off a 1,000 square foot plot of paved land during a 1-inch rainstorm? 20 gallons? 50 gallons? 100 gallons? 1000 gallons?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall:
- The area of the surface is calcualted in square feet and convereted to cubic inches to match our measure of rainfall, inches.
- The volume, in cubic inches of runoff is calculated by multiplying the rainfall amount (1 inch), by the area of the surface.
- The volumetric measure is convereted to gallons.
